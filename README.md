# Automatic-Braking-System
This system was designed to simulate an automatic breaking system and display the distance from the sensor and motor to the detected object. This type of design can be found in many newer vehicles or different robotic applicataions. VHDL was the programming language used to create this project using the Quartus II software. The program was flashed to the Altera DE2 board which executed the automatic breakng system program. The other components used in this project was a Ultra Sonic Sensor and a DC brushless motor.
Breif explanation of the source code: The ultrasonic sensor sends out an trigger pulse at a certian frequency, if an object is in range then and trigger pulse will bounce off of the object and send a echo pulse back to the reciever on the ultrasonic sensor. The sensor records the time it takes for the echo to return to the sensor. Once the time is recorded, the distnace can be calculated by using a formula found on the internet. This value is this displayed to the DE2 board for the user to check and make sure the value is correct. Then a predifined distance is set for the sensor to determine when to cut power to the motor, causing the motor to instanly stop spinning. Once the object is moved out of the distance, the motor will then again begin to spin.
