# Automatic-Braking-System
This system was designed to simulate an automatic breaking system and display the distance from the sensor and motor to the detected object. This type of design can be found in many newer vehicles or different robotic applicataions. VHDL was the programming language used to create this project using the Quartus II software. The program was flashed to the Altera DE2 board which executed the automatic breakng system program. The other components used in this project was a Ultra Sonic Sensor and a DC brushless motor.
